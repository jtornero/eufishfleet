# eufishfleet

Description
==========

eufishfleet is a collection of SQL scripts to build a PostgreSQL database for storing and querying
EU Fleet Register on the NeT, available for querying/download at:

http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/fleet/

Some fields are extended to hold up to 255 characters, providing there is no information about the length of those fields in the official implementation of the database.

This is a very simple implementation, which needs further development, but enough for simple query purposes.
